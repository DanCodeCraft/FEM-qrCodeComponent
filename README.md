## Overview

The challenge was to design a QR code with given design choices.
I decided to keep it simple and use purely HTML and CSS, with one media query to adapt to mobile devices.

### What I learned

I'm a very beginner, with something like 2 weeks of experience in this.
Everything was a challenge, and took me about 1 hour and a half from download to deployment.

### Continued development

My goal is to change my career in my late 30's.
And I chose to be a front end developer.
I'm "mastering" HTML and CSS to jump into JS and React.
